Next Digital Table Tennis Ranking
=================================

This is a simple AngularJS application I have created with Firebase in order to keep track and facilitate the rankings of the ultra competitive table tennis arena at Next Digital.

To Do
-----

This is very much a work in progress and when time permits will add the following:

*	Proper users and Authentication - Right now anybody can be added or add matches
*	Match history
*	Improved Validation
*	Rounding of points
*	Tweak the scoring algorithm, possibly include decay and different weighting
*	Add different match types eg. Short, Normal, Tournament - These will change the weighting
*	Jasmine tests - Was more concerned with learning how firebase works at this stage
